# Cayley Graphs!!

A software to visualize groups given by a group presentation. Aimed at undergraduate students and undergraduate teachers. Developed with Unity.
The WebApp can be accessed here: https://jeanbellynck.github.io/graphicayley

## Target Audience
This application is aimed at the following people
- Undergraduate students (who want to visualize a group from their lectures)
- Graduate students (who want to understand geometric and combinatorial group theory)
- Researchers (who are short on time and don't want to draw out a cayley graph by hand)
- Visualization enthusiasts (who see theselves as part of a mathematical visualization movement and simply wnat to play around)

If you are of one of the above groups you might like the following features

### Undergraduate students
- The gallery contains pretty much all groups which are studied in an algebra class. The generator can be used without understanding what a presentation is
- Hovering over a group gives a short description in form of a pop-up. A right click refers the user to the Wikipedia article
- An explanation for what a presentation is, is included in an expandable window


### Graduate students
- You can study groups visually and gain a new perspective
- The gallery gives some inspiration on what groups could be studied
- You can study actions on presentations visually (like HNN-extensions, free products and so on)

### Researchers
- There is hardly an other application out there to visualize presentations
- The application gives you a way to study your own favorite group

### Visualization enthusiasts
- Using the app pretty pictures of groups can be generated
